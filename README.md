# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment Analysis is a procedure used to determine if a chunk of text is positive, negative or neutral.This is a basic sentiment analysis code. I've imported required libraries for the project and some of which are specific to individual methods. The general requirements are as follows:
nltk.classify.util
scikit-learn
corpus
nltk
I've used different feature sets and machine learning classifiers to determine the best combination for sentiment analysis and finally trained the classifier using machine-learning algorithm - Naive Bayes Classifier
